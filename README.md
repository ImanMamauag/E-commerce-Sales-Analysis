# E-commerce-Sales-Analysis
## Business Task
The E-commerce business generates a large volume of sales transactions across multiple regions and product categories, but the raw data is fragmented with varying order statuses and fulfillment outcomes. Without proper analysis, it is difficult for management to track revenue performance, cancellation trends, and customer buying behavior. This project aims to transform the raw sales report into actionable insights by creating clean metrics such as Gross Sales, Net Sales, Average Order Value, and fulfillment rates to support data-driven decision-making.

## Approach
This project will clean and standardize the e-commerce sales report by filtering valid order statuses and categorizing transactions into fulfilled, cancelled, and returned groups. Using SQL, key performance indicators such as Gross Sales, Net Sales, Average Order Value, and cancellation rates will be calculated and visualized to provide actionable insights for business decisions.

## Results
The analysis of the e-commerce sales report revealed that the business generated a total **Gross Sales of 78590043.30 INR** during the period. After accounting for cancellations and returns amounting to **8929385.30 INR**, the **Net Sales stood at 69660658.00 INR**. The **Average Order Value (AOV) was 694.23 INR**, while the **cancellation rate was 11.36%**, highlighting opportunities to improve fulfillment and reduce lost revenue.
