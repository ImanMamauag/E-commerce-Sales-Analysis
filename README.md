# E-commerce-Sales-Analysis
## Business Task
The E-commerce business generates a large volume of sales transactions across multiple regions and product categories, but the raw data is fragmented with varying order statuses and fulfillment outcomes. Without proper analysis, it is difficult for management to track revenue performance, cancellation trends, and customer buying behavior. 

This project aims to transform the raw sales report into actionable insights by creating clean metrics such as **Gross Sales, Net Sales, Average Order Value, and fulfillment rates** to support data-driven decision-making.

## Approach
+ Cleaned and standardized the e-commerce sales report.
+ Filtered valid order statuses and categorized transactions into **fulfilled, cancelled, and returned** groups.
+ Built SQL queries to compute key performance indicators (KPIs):
  + **Gross Sales**
  + **Net Sales**
  + **Average Order Value (AOV)**
  + **Cancellation Rates**  

## Results
+ **Gross Sales:** ₹78.6M
+ **Cancellations & Returns:** ₹8.9M
+ **Net Sales:** ₹69.7M
+ **Average Order Value (AOV):** ₹694.23
+ **Cancellation Rate:** 11.36%

These insights highlight both the revenue potential and areas where operational improvements can reduce cancellations and maximize profitability.
