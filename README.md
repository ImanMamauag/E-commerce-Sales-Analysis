## Dataset and Technical Information
<p align="justify"> This [e-commerce sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlock-profits-with-e-commerce-sales-data), created by ANil through web scraping and last updated in 2022, provides a detailed view of online business performance and profitability. It contains product-level details (SKU, categories, sizes, colors), transactional information (dates, order status, quantities, gross amounts), and pricing data across multiple platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, and Paytm. Designed for research and analysis, the dataset enables insights into sales trends, fulfillment, cancellations, and overall profitability in the e-commerce marketplace.</p>


## Objectives
+ Turn raw sales data into clear KPIs for tracking revenue, cancellations, and customer behavior. 
+ Highlight trends and performance drivers to guide strategies for growth and fulfillment improvement.


## Executive Summary
<p align="justify"> The analysis shows that while the business generated strong gross sales of ₹78.6M, cancellations and returns (₹8.9M) reduced net sales to ₹69.7M, with a cancellation rate of 11.36%. Sales are concentrated in a few categories, with “Set” accounting for nearly half of total revenue, and in a few regions such as Maharashtra, which alone contributes ~16%. To sustain growth, the business should reduce cancellations by addressing logistics and fulfillment challenges, diversify its product mix to reduce dependency on a single category, and expand sales in underperforming regions. Additionally, customer spending can be increased through product bundling, personalized offers, and loyalty programs, while retention strategies such as targeted campaigns can drive repeat orders. These actions will strengthen revenue performance, reduce leakage, and unlock new growth opportunities.</p>


## Key Insights
+ Gross sales reached ₹78.6M, but cancellations and returns (₹8.9M) reduced net sales to ₹69.7M.
+ Average Order Value (₹694) remained stable but showed slight fluctuations across Q2.
+ Orders cancelled spiked sharply toward the end of Q2, pulling down fulfillment performance.
+ Sales are heavily concentrated in a few categories (“Set” alone accounts for ~50% of sales) and regions (Maharashtra contributes ~16%).
+ Cancellation rate stands at 11.36%, highlighting a revenue leakage point.
+ Strong performance in high-volume categories and regions indicates opportunities for scaling what already works.
+ Customer order behavior shows consistency, but value growth depends on upselling and cross-selling.


 ## Recommendations
+ Closely monitor cancellation patterns by product category and courier performance to identify root causes.
+ Diversify sales mix by promoting underperforming categories (e.g., Bottoms, Sarees) to reduce reliance on a single product line.
+ Develop region-specific campaigns to capture growth outside the top contributing states.
+ **Reduce Cancellations** – Partner with logistics teams to improve delivery success rates, optimize stock availability, and provide proactive customer communication.
+ **Grow Customer Spend** – Introduce product bundling, personalized offers, and loyalty programs to push AOV above ₹700.
+ **Expand Market Reach** – Launch targeted marketing in emerging states and underperforming categories to unlock new demand pockets.
+ **Retention & Repeat Orders** – Analyze repeat vs. new customer trends and invest in strategies (email campaigns, app notifications) that encourage repeat purchases.


## Next Steps
1.	**Fulfillment Fix** – Conduct a root-cause analysis of cancellations and returns, focusing on courier performance and stock availability.
2.	**Sales Diversification** – Identify and promote underperforming categories and explore marketing campaigns for emerging states.
3.	**Customer Growth** – Launch cross-sell/upsell bundles and loyalty programs to raise AOV above ₹700.
4.	**Retention Strategy** – Segment customers and roll out personalized retention campaigns to drive repeat purchases.

For this project, I performed data [cleaning](az_sales_dataCleaning.sql) and transformation using SQL to prepare the dataset for [analysis](az_sales_eda.sql). The processed dataset was then [visualized](E-commerce Sales Dashboard.PNG) in Power BI.
